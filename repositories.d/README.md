## External repositories

Here you may add any external repositories you may wich to use.

Just add a file with the name of the repository with the extension `.url`.
The contents of the file are the git repositories, such as `https://github.com/TimLuq/mc-plugin`, one per line.

The repositories must have a directory called `mc-plugins` at the root level to have any effect.
